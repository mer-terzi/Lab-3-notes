Pathways et donc ROIS?

but keep in mind this is for faces (not CNS)

- •The pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pACC) is the core center for smiling.
    
- •Disgust production and recognition depends on the anterior insula (AI).
    
- •Fear experience and recognition depends on the amygdala.
    
- •In blindsights emotional expressions is recognized via SC-Pul-STS pathway.
    

Also time response for conscious vs unconscious using facial rxn and pupilary response : “Interestingly, facial reactions were shown to be faster and pupil dilation higher for non-consciously than for consciously perceived facial and bodily expressions.”

urthermore, neuroimaging studies showed that the superior colliculus, pulvinar, and amygdala constitute a functional network that exhibits an increased, positive covariation of activity in response to non-consciously perceived emotional facial expressions ([Morris et al., 1999](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393217303226#bib62), [Liddell et al., 2005](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393217303226#bib50)).
