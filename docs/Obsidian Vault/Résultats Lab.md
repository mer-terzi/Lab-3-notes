1) Hémisphere
	1) Seen : Left
		1) Makes sense because its still intact
	2) Unseen : Both 
		1) Articles :
			1) [[Right Hemisphere Dominance for Unconscious Emotionally Salient Stimuli]]
			2) [[What cortical areas are responsible for blindsight in hemianopic patients?]]
				1) Cortical thickness of intact hemisphere
2) ROIs
	1) Seen : 
		1) [[Temporal and spatial neural dynamics in the perception of basic emotions from complex scenes]]
	2) Unseen : Less amygdala, V1, thalamus early if unseen, but makes sense as insufficient sensory information
		1) [[What cortical areas are responsible for blindsight in hemianopic patients?]]
		2) [[Pathways for smiling, disgust and fear recognition in blindsight patients]]
3) Time Window
	1) Seen : Early + mid
		1) [[Decoding the temporal dynamics of affective scene processing]]
	2) Unseen : Later but also crosses around mid.
		1) [[Electrophysiological correlates of affective blindsight]]
4) Frequency
	1) Seen : Low Gamma
		1) [[The dynamics of EEG gamma responses to unpleasant visual stimuli  From local activity to functional connectivity]]
	2) Unseen: Beta
		1) [[Emotional expressions modulate low α and β oscillations in a cortically blind patient]]
		2) [[A review of brain oscillations in perception of faces and emotional pictures]] and also gamma!
		3) maybe  [[Affective blindsight relies on low spatial frequencies]] but big stretch imo
5) RT :
	1) Faster for unpleasant independent of S-U
		1) [[A Rapid Subcortical Amygdala Route for Faces Irrespective of Spatial Frequency and Emotion]]
		2) Fast unconscious unpleasant [[Unconsciously perceived fear in peripheral vision alerts the limbic system]]
		3) Negativity bias ? [[Bad is Stronger than Good]]
			1) [[Emotion, attention, and the ‘negativity bias’, studied through event-related potentials]] In which P200 (attention related) is modulated by negativity bias 
		4) [[Reaction time normative data for the IAPSas a function of display time, gender,and picture content]] Potentially interesting RT correlate with valence 
6) Linear Regression
	1) Seen :
		1) [[Regional brain responses to pleasant and unpleasant IAPS pictures Different networks]]
		2) Early : low frequency, precuneus, frontal cortex and limbic system
				1) [[Top–Down Enhancement and Suppression of Activity in Category-selective Extrastriate Cortex from an Act of Reflective Attention]] role of precuneus in CNS
				2) 
			2) 
		3) Mid : GC amygdala-limbic system
		4) Late : Gamma
	3) Unseen
		1) Early : 
			1) Thalamus, Intact V1, STS 
			2) early alpha in middle frontal regions
		2) Mid : GC amygdala-limbic also!
	4) Both :
		1) Early + late in parahippocampal gyrus and precuneus are key in influencing RTs.
