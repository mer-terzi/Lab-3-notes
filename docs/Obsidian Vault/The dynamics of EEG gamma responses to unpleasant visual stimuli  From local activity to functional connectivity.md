► We studied the cortical dynamics induced by unpleasant picture viewing. ► We analyzed ERPs, gamma rhythm modulation, its inter-trial and between-areas phase synchrony. ► We found increased gamma activity during viewing of unpleasant pictures. ► Stronger synchronizations for unpleasant stimuli occurred at low gamma frequencies. ► Specific intervals of gamma are involved in specific aspects of emotion processing.
