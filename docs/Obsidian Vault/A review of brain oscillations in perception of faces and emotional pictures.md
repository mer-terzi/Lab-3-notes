Beta oscillatory responses on presentation of face, facial expression and IAPS pictures
both alpha and beta responses for emotional stimuli and not for neutral stimuli
IN SEEN
Özgören, Başar-Eroğlu, and Başar (2005)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393214000992#bib254) reported prolonged frontal event-related beta oscillations in response to unknown faces compared with those to known faces. [Sakihara et al. (2012)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393214000992#bib282) showed that event-related beta synchronisation over the right prefrontal region was significantly greater in response to the participant’s own face than to a familiar face at 400–800 ms post-stimulus [Fig. 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393214000992#f0015).
