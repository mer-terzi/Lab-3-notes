- An individual with cortical blindness was investigated using brain imaging (fMRI).
    
- •Unseen fearful faces were found to activate the right amygdala.
    
- •Activation was maintained for low spatial frequency components of fearful faces.
    
- •Affective blindsight thus seems to rely on information from low spatial frequencies.
    
    en gros le lien que je vx faire c’est For unseen stimuli (as in affective blindsight), the processing of low spatial frequencies could lead to a lack of awareness but still allow for some recognition of emotional content. This might correspond to patterns of brain activity that do not rely on high-frequency oscillations like gamma waves.
