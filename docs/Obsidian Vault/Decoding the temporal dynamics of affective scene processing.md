- Temporal dynamics of affective scene processing was investigated with MVPA.
    
- Perceptual processing of affective scenes began in [visual cortex](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/visual-cortex "Learn more about visual cortex from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") ∼100 ms.
    
- Affect-specific neural representations emerged between ∼200 ms to ∼300 ms.
    
- Affect-specific neural representations were sustained.
    
- Sustained representations may be supported by recurrent neural interactions.
