We identified seven scene-selective ROIs for further analysis;[2](https://direct.mit.edu/jocn/article/21/12/2320/4759/Top-Down-Enhancement-and-Suppression-of-Activity#FN2) these were located in the bilateral middle occipital gyrus (MOG), bilateral PPA, bilateral retrosplenial cortex (RSC), and **right precuneus** (PCu)/intraparietal sulcus (IPS); locations are shown in Figure 2H. We concentrated on these regions because a prior study (Johnson et al., 2007) had **identified them in a localizer task as being relatively selective for scenes (i.e., activating more for scenes than faces, although not necessarily exclusively activating for scenes vs. other stimulus classes)** and examined refresh-related activity in them. Our previous study had also identified the **PCu/IPS region on the left, but only the right PCu/IPS activity was found to differ significantly among conditions** in the present study.
