complete cortical blindness using faces

An initial changes in pattern of activity occurred at around 70 ms in the STS/MT region which did not differentiate fearful from other emotions or emotional expressions in general from neutral ones.

- Differences became specific to fearful faces from approximately 120 ms onwards in the right IFG, followed by the anterior cingulate, right OFC and medial superior frontal gyrus. Beyond 150 ms, a bilateral medial and superior temporal activity was observed along with changes in the right amygdala. Overall differences between emotional and neutral faces occurred at around 205 ms.
    
- While our study cannot rule out the existence of the colliculopulvino-amygdala pathway, it appears to favour the hypothesis of a geniculo-extrastriate route to explain affective blindsight. This is important since the anatomical and physiological evidence for a pulvino-collicular pathway are tenuous. Indeed, despite considerable research in primates showing a rich connectivity pattern for the amygdala (uni/bidirectional connections with 118 areas) (McDonald, 1998; Ghashghaei and Barbas, 2002; Lisa Stefanacci, 2002), no evidence has been found so far for a direct superior colliculusamygdala connection
